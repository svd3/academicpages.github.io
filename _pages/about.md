Hi I'm Saurabh. I'm currently a Ph.D student in Electrical Engineering at Rice University.
I'm working with Dr. Xaq Pitkow in his computational neuroscience lab.

Before starting at Rice, I worked at Samsung Research for 2 years.

I did my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras and graduated in 2014.  

My research interests are Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Graphical Models.
